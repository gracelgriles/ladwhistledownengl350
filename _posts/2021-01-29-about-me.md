#**About Grace Griles** 

_Basic information_
* I'm academically a junior even though I started as a freshman last semester.
* My preferred pronouns are she/her.
* I am very excited to be taking this course, even though I didn't know what DH was until I read the syllabus.
Before I get anymore personal, I thought it would be good to at least show you what I look like.
[Well here's what I look like.](https://github.com/gracelgriles/ladwhistledownengl350/blob/main/images/profile.jpegsmaller.JPG?raw=true).
