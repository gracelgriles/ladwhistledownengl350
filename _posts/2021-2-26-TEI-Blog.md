# My First Experience with TEI
### by Grace Griles
I was given the assignment to code pages 31-35 of "The Yellow Wallpaper" using TEI also known as Text Coding Initiative. "The Yellow Wallpaper" is a short story written by Charlotte Perkins Stetson. It was published in 1892 in the New England Magazine. The story is the monologue and of a woman who is going completely insane. She starts obsessing over the yellow wallpaper in her house, and it's rather apparent this behavior isn't normal. Her husband is a doctor, so you would think that he would be of great help to her. However, instead of helping her he goes into a state of denial constantly telling ehr that she's perfectly fine when she asks for help. It was a very interesting story to read, but it was also handwritten which scared me at first. Later it was revealed that my professor had taken the time to type out each of my classmates' sections into a Google Doc to avoid confusion. 


The first step of this project was to highlight our assigned sections of the text and comment in the Google Doc what we needed to code. For example, if a new page started **"<pb"**, quotes were _"<q>"_ and the code for underlining is rather long, so I'll spare you from looking at that one. This step is rather essential and was extremely helpful when I was coding, but it would have been even more helpful if I wasn't late for class, misunderstood the directions, and labeled some things wrong.
  Here you might be able to spot where I forgot to note where a word was underlined.

When I first saw OxygenTEI, I was rather intimidated, and when I saw the instructions I was still intimidated. It wasn't until I actually started coding that the intimidation started to decrease. I think it was because it looked intimidating and once I actually tried it and I saw that it wasn't that hard. The reason I was so worried about it was because I am not a very patient person, especially with subjects I am unfamiliar with. The closest I've ever come to coding before starting this class was editing videos on Adobe Premiere Pro. Obviously that is nothing like coding, but it is something technological that requires a lot of tedious steps. I enjoy making and editing videos, but I still found the process discouraging and tedious. Therefore when I found out I needed to do a tedious technological task for class regularly, I didn't have a lot of confidence in my ability to not give up. However, I feel that Professor Stover's thorough instructions have helped me become less frustrated and actually start to enjoy these assignments.
