# Grant Process and Refelction 

## by Grace Griles

Admittedly I have never written anything close to a grant before, so I was rather nervous to start this project. However, when I found my topic my nervousness faded into excitement. My topic is about how the isolation due to the pandemic is affecting the development of children ages newborn to elementary school. Socializing is crucial to brain development during these ages. Therefore, being placed in complete isolation will lead to never before seen results. These results could be negative. It is essential that the research starts on this subject while it is happening so that future researchers has access to accurate information. This information will also be helpful to the children who were affected oce they grow up when they start noticing their different social patterns.  I plan to put all of this information in a set of online archives that will be accessible to the public. 

 I find the idea of doing research on this topic fascinating because a pandemic is a rare event, and the way the world is handling education right now has never been done before. Pre-pandemic socializing was not something children had to seek out. It was natural. As someone who was homeschooled from first grade to highschool I have experienced first hand how isolation can affect an individual's development long term. In fact, the way my education was presented to me was rather similar to how the subjects of this study are experiencing education similar to mine. 

When I first imagined my project I envisioned making a series of podcasts. The only reason I thought of this was because I honestly do not have that much experience with building a DH project, and I didn't know the options I had. It wasn't until I did poorly on my proposal and met with Dr. Stover that I realized an archive would be the best option. Dr. Stover also helped me to realize that it would be best if I focused this study on one specific area. She prodded me towards focusing on the Hampton Roads area.  Dr. Stover also sent me some projects that were similar to mine. I also looked up a few myself and found that my projecte differs by the specificness of the location, age group, and the way it focuses solely on the impacts of the education the children are receiving. Also majority of the projects are public entry based which is good because it creates a space for unique, individualized archives. However, I think it would be helpful to include a professionals opinion with the entries. This will be a helpful resource when nonprofessionals read the archives and the professionals comments explain why an individual may have said something in their entry. I am still brainstorming on how to include this in my proposal or if I will at all. Either way I will keep the public entry aspect to keep the interactiveness of this project to make it a Digital Humanities project. 

Before I took this class I did not have any prior knowledge about the Digital Humanities. In fact I wasn't even sure what Digital Humanities was when I signed up for this class.  Now I know that Digital Humanities has a running definition that is constantly being debated. The first few readings Dr. Stover assigned by Jason Heppler and Anne Burdick helped set the groundwork for my understanding of DH (Digital Humanities). I also grew to appreciate how inclusive and interactive it can be, and how it has provided opportunities for niche parts of history to be explored. When I reviewed different DH projects I learned alot about parts of history I had never even thought to research. My favorite DH project I reviewed was about how celebrity gossip effected societal views in the early 19th century. That being said I would say that the Review Blogs were my favorite even though I struggled with them. The reason I struggled was only because I had never worked in a platform like GitHub before, and I experienced a lot of burn out this semester. Therefore there is nothing wrong with the assignment itself. This class has helped me grow as a writer by showing me that in the digital age is important to ensure that you are well versed in digital aspects as well as linguistic aspects. As stated earlier, I had no clue what DH was before this class: however, now that I do I believe I will pursue it a bit more. Below is a screenshot of the Twitter account I made for this class, which I am very proud of, despite the fact that I was not consistent in tweeting.
