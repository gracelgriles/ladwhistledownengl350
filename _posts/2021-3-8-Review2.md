###Summary

The DH project I chose to Review was **Archival Gossip**. This project appealed to me because it discussed a subject that I heard of but never read or discussed in length. **Archival Gossip** is about how celebrity gossip has affected women throughout the late 19th and 20th century. The concept of gossip is thought to discuss gender, sexuality, privacy, and publicity. How they traced this was by cross referencing realist fiction, magazines, and private individuals’ life writing and how it affected (auto)biographies of the time. All of this information is found on the [_summary section_](https://www.archivalgossip.com/) of the opening page. As you scroll down you are prompted to click on the [_blog section_](https://www.archivalgossip.com/blog/) for more information. Here I found quotes from old gossip columns and some explanations. An example is  "'Cushman was open about her love affairs and became known as a polyamorous heartbreaker, who often maintained more than one relationship at a time' (“This history-making lesbian actress played Romeo & broke many women’s hearts,” Victoria A. Brownworth, 2019." This section was rather intersting, and I beleive one of my favorite part of the project. Below is a picture of a few more quotes like these.

This collection site highlighted one of the female stars that was the highlight of column gossip in the late 19th and early 20th century. Her name was Charlotte Cushman. It goes on to say that she was the first renowed American actress to be famous in both Europe and America. I then points to where one can find more information on Cushman and that she was mostly feautred in the two magazines Anne Hamptom Brewster and Grace Greenwood. 

###Review

This is was the main structure of the entire project. There would be link at the end of each section that would elaborate on the project. This method was helpful as far as going in depth with the material. However, each link didn't open a new tab which sent me down a rabbit hole. If each link led to a different
