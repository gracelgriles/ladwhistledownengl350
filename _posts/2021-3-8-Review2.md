### Summary

The DH project I chose to Review was **Archival Gossip**. This project appealed to me because it discussed a subject that I heard of but never read or discussed in length. **Archival Gossip** is about how celebrity gossip has affected women throughout the late 19th and 20th century. The concept of gossip is thought to discuss gender, sexuality, privacy, and publicity. How they traced this was by cross referencing realist fiction, magazines, and private individuals’ life writing and how it affected (auto)biographies of the time. All of this information is found on the [_summary section_](https://www.archivalgossip.com/) of the opening page. As you scroll down you are prompted to click on the [_blog section_](https://www.archivalgossip.com/blog/) for more information. Here I found quotes from old gossip columns and some explanations. An example is  "'Cushman was open about her love affairs and became known as a polyamorous heartbreaker, who often maintained more than one relationship at a time' (“This history-making lesbian actress played Romeo & broke many women’s hearts,” Victoria A. Brownworth, 2019." This section was rather intersting, and I beleive one of my favorite part of the project. Below is a picture of a few more quotes like these.

Below the link to this blog, there was a section that prompted me to click on their [collection site](https://www.archivalgossip.com/collection/). This collection site highlighted one of the female stars that was the highlight of column gossip in the late 19th and early 20th century. Her name was Charlotte Cushman. It goes on to say that she was the first renowed American actress to be famous in both Europe and America. I then points to where one can find more information on Cushman and that she was mostly feautred in the two magazines Anne Hamptom Brewster and Grace Greenwood. 

### Technology

This is was the main structure of the entire project. There would be link at the end of each section that would elaborate on the project. This method was helpful as far as going in depth with the material. However, each link didn't open a new tab which sent me down a rabbit hole. If each link led to a different tab it would've been easier to compare the information side by side. The aesthetic of the website fit the project's subject. There were pictures of the original gossip columns included throughout the sections that discussed them. The fonts that were used were an old fashion cursive which fit the ambiance of the project.

### Findings

I was under the impression that the project would focus on how gossip columns has effected the ideas of sexuality, gender, privacy, and publicity over the years. Instead it was a very narrow proejct that focused on one celebrity. It was very interesting to see how this one celebrity changed so many ideas. One the other hand it would've been interesting to see this project be expanded. Especially since this was a rather old celebrity that is not very popular in the current year. As mentioned before the celebrity the project focused on was named _Charlotte Cushman_. She challenge the idea of sexuality when rumors got out about her living with a woman lover in Rome. Since she was one of the most tlaked about woman of her time the idea of her being queer opened up the discussion of being queer. This is a prime example of what the study was trying to make a point of how celebrities effected the ideas of society.

### Critiques

The project itsef was well thought out and thorouhgly researched, but it might be more interesting if it was broader. The title and the introduction was also somewhat misleading because it elluded the idea that it was going to discuss more than one celebrity's impact. As I stated earlier, I would have preferred for the links to open a new tab to avoid the rabbit hole affect. Another technological diffiulty was when you switched tabs and came back to the project it automatically moved the page to the top. 


**Overall** the project was very insightful and thorough. The subject was interesting, ad being able to focus on one celebrity did make the project less overwhelming even though learning baout different celebrities would have been interesting to see.
