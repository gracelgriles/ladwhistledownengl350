## **Summary**

Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761: a Cartographic Narrative_ tells a part of history that few history curriculums, or at least in my experience, focus on. This project tells the story of how the slaves in Jamaica took advantage of their master's being busy fighting The Seven Year's War by attempting to escape or revolt. The Multi-layered Interactive Map shows where the slave revolts took place and where slaves escaped to across the island of Jamaica from April of 1760 to October of 1761. In the first tab of the project section, there is a more in-depth summary of the events the map displays. It talks about how the uprising included a total of fifteen hundred slaves. Five hundred of them died during casualties. Another five hundred were banished from the island for life, and only sixty white men were killed. Vincent Brown, the director, not only educates his audience about this event but also takes time to pose questions about the event. What were the goals of the slaves? Was this a unified effort? If it was why didn't the slaves succeed? And after looking at the number, was this revolt an actual threat to the British Empire? Or was it blown out of proportions by panicked white slave owners?
