**Summary**

_Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760-1761: a Cartographic Narrative_ tells a part of history that not many history curriculums, or at least in my experience, focus on. This project tells the story of how the slaves in Jaimaca took advantage of their master's being busy fighting The Seven Year's War by attempting to escape or revolt. The Multi-layered Interactive Map shows where the slave revolts took place and where slaves excaped to across the island of Jamaica from April of 1760 to October of 1761. The top of the project section gives a summary of the events the map displays and what will be discussed through out the project. It talks about how the uprising incuded a total of fiteen hundred slaves, five hundred of them died during caulaties, another five hundered were banished form the island for life, and they only killed sixty white men.
